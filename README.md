Problem Statement : 
Online shopping â€” that glorious invention which allows people to buy things from the comfort of their homes. No more travelling to multiple stores to find the right product; no more having to deal with over-enthusiastic sales persons; no more standing in long lines at the checkout counter. The e-commerce boom has certainly changed the way we shop for the better. But, like everything else, the world of online shopping is not all roses. Despite all the efforts of e-commerce companies to alleviate them, there are a few problems that customers still have to face while shopping online.

These are :

1. Customers have to visit various e-commerce sites in order to buy anything.
2. More option leads to more confusion.
3. Consume much time in deciding which product to buy and to from which e-commerce site.
 
Proposed Solution : 
We are thinking of designing and implementing Single e-Commerce Platform to ensure follwing things :

1. One place where customers can compare between same product within different e-commerce or different products within same 
   e-commerce based on -
    a. price of the product
    b. product rating count
    c. customer reviews
    d. seller rating count
    
2. The single e-commerce platform will cover most of the e-commerce sites such as Aliexpress, Flipkart, Amazon and Ebay etc.

3. A real time comparison between all the e-Commerce.

4. Platform will recommend the best 5 options of the searched product.

5. End Users/Customers will be able to find the best option for them using this platform.


Technology Stack :

1. Web Scraping : Scrapy,Beautiful Soup
2. Database : MySQL-Workbench or PostGres
3. User Interface through Flask-python interface

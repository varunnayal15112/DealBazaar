We are thinking of designing and implementing Single e-Commerce Platform to ensure follwing things :

1. One place where customers can compare between same product within different e-commerce or different products within same 
   e-commerce based on ->
   	a. price of the product
   	b. product rating count
   	c. customer reviews
   	d. seller rating count
   	
2. The single e-commerce platform will cover most of the e-commerce sites such as Aliexpress, Flipkart, Amazon and Ebay etc.

3. A real time comparison between all the e-Commerce.

4. Platform will recommend the best 5 options of the searched product.

5. End Users/Customers will be able to find the best option for them using this platform.


Technology Stack :

1. Web Scraping : Scrapy,Beautiful Soup
2. Database : MySQL-Workbench or PostGres
3. User Interface through Flask-python interface

Online shopping â€” that glorious invention which allows people to buy things from the comfort of their homes. No more travelling to multiple stores to find the right product; no more having to deal with over-enthusiastic sales persons; no more standing in long lines at the checkout counter. The e-commerce boom has certainly changed the way we shop for the better. But, like everything else, the world of online shopping is not all roses. Despite all the efforts of e-commerce companies to alleviate them, there are a few problems that customers still have to face while shopping online.

These are :

1. Customers have to visit various e-commerce sites in order to buy anything.
2. More option leads to more confusion.
3. Consume much time in deciding which product to buy and to from which e-commerce site.
